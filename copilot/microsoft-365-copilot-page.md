# Manage Microsoft 365 Copilot settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center

You can manage Microsoft 365 Copilot through the Microsoft 365 admin center by going to the Settings tab on the Copilot page. Manage how users in your organization interact with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Security Copilot, and more.

## Before you begin

- The experience on the Copilot page in the Microsoft 365 admin center depends on whether your organization has a Copilot license. If your organization has a Copilot license, you will see settings specific to managing Copilot features. If your organization does not have a Copilot license, you will see settings for the public version of Copilot. For more information, see [Get started with Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-setup.md).

- Any admin role can access the Copilot page, but only certain roles can adjust settings. For more information, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

## How to get to the Settings tab on the Copilot page

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center.

2. In the left navigation, select **Copilot**.

3. Select the **Settings** tab.

### Licenses

You can manage Copilot licenses, including assigning and unassigning licenses, for your users. For more information, see [License plans for Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-licensing.md).

### Manage how your organization interacts with Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

For users signed in with a Microsoft Entra account, Microsoft 365 Copilot offers [enterprise data protection](/copilot/microsoft-365/enterprise-data-protection) (EDP) in an experience designed for work and education. Users who aren't signed in, or are signed in with a personal account, can use the public version of Copilot, accessed primarily through [copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) and [bing.com/chat](https://bing.com/chat).

To ensure that users in your organization access Copilot Chat, follow these [instructions on managing Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat](/copilot/manage).
